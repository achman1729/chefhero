## 1 | The Problem 
Wasted potential is something everyone deals with where it be potential in themselves or potential in the people around them. Wasted potential is usually accompanied by an unrequited passion that can sometimes seem unreached as personal life matters, repsonsibilities get in many peoples ways of ever diving deep into that passion. 

One such passion is Cooking. Cooking is a hobby that only a few ever make a career out of, not because of lack of skill, but more so because of lack of knowhow. Knowhow of where to start such a career, large barriers to entry of starting up their own restaurant, and knowhow of the process it takes to share one's great food and dishes with the masses.

## 2 | The Solution
ChefHero provides the solution to hopefully capture all this wasted potential. ChefHero is a 2-way marketplace where anybody who believes their cooking skills are above average- a place to share/sell, and for customers to buy these dishes. 

For foodies, ChefHero is a platform to find great, high quality, homecooked meals from local ChefHeroes that before could not share their creations.

For inspiring chefs, ChefHero is a platform that finally gives them the ability to expore their cooking passion without the crazy high barriers to entry a normal restaurant startup would face.  

ChefHero is community driven and functions of the shared passion for local homecooked meals that could definitely be competitive in quality with a Foodie's fine-dining alternative.
